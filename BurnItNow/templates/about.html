            <div class="about-content">
                <h2>Our Journey Begins</h2>
                <p>It all started with a group of six college students, each with a passion for technology and a desire to make a positive impact. Among them was Dave Dominic Goze, our lead developer, whose love for coding drove the project forward.</p>
                <div id="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
                    <h2>A Common Goal</h2>
                    <p>As part of our final project for our Intelligent Systems course, we set out to tackle a common problem: accurately tracking calorie expenditure during physical activities. It was a challenge we had all faced, and we were determined to find a solution.</p>
                    <h2>The Birth of an Idea</h2>
                    <p>Driven by our shared goal of helping others lead healthier lives, we came up with the concept for Calories Burnt Predictor. We wanted to create an app that could predict calorie burn with precision, making it easier for people to reach their fitness goals.</p>
                    <h2>Dedication and Hard Work</h2>
                    <p>With our vision in mind, we dove headfirst into the project. Late nights and early mornings became the norm as we coded, tested, and refined the app. Despite the challenges we faced along the way, our dedication never wavered.</p>
                    <h2>A Dream Realized</h2>
                    <p>After weeks of hard work, the app was finally ready. With its intuitive interface and accurate predictions, it exceeded our expectations. We couldn't wait to share it with the world and make a difference in people's lives.</p>
                    <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
                    <p>At BurnItNow, we're more than just a group of developers â€“ we're a team on a mission. Our goal is to empower you to lead a healthier, happier life by providing you with the tools you need to succeed.</p>
